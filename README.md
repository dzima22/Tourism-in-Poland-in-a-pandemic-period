# 🚀 Research Problem:

- The report investigates the most popular tourist destinations in Poland during the pandemic and the extent to which the pandemic influenced changes in tourist preferences. Additionally, it assesses whether traditional factors of regional attractiveness remained significant during the pandemic.
# ❓ Research Questions:

 1. What were the most popular tourist destinations in Poland during the pandemic?
 2. How did the pandemic affect changes in tourist preferences?
 3. Did traditional attractiveness factors of regions still matter during the pandemic?
# 📈 Interesting Findings:

- In this chart we can observe the *spending distribution of Polish tourists over the age of 15* across various expenditure categories during the pandemic. It is evident that Poles spent more domestically than abroad during this period, despite international travel often being more costly. The highest expenditure was on accommodation, indicating that `Polish tourists prioritized finding quality lodging and allocated significant amounts to this category compared to other expenses`.

- Based on the  chart, we can conclude that the most attractive regions for `German tourists` were those neighboring Germany, including `Zachodniopomorskie`, `Pomorskie`, `Lubuskie`, `Wielkopolskie`, `Dolnośląskie`, `Śląskie`, as well as `Mazowieckie` and `Małopolskie`. German tourists constituted the largest percentage of foreign tourists in Poland during the pandemic, a trend that remained unchanged from before the pandemic.

 - The second largest group of foreign tourists in Poland were `Ukrainians`, who preferred regions such as `Lubelskie`, `Podkarpackie`, `Mazowieckie`, `Małopolskie`, `Śląskie`, and `Dolnośląskie`. The Mazowieckie region was particularly attractive to Ukrainian tourists due to its proximity to the border and overall popularity among foreign tourists.
 - Although `British and American tourists` made up the third and fourth largest groups, their numbers were significantly smaller. Based on this information, we `accept the hypothesis` that the largest percentage of foreign tourists during the pandemic came from neighboring countries. Additionally, the most popular regions among them were border regions, with the exceptions of Małopolskie and Mazowieckie

- Looking at the expenditure structure, we can see that `American tourists` spent almost as much as `Ukrainian tourist`s during the pandemic, despite `being half as many in number`. This may be due to significant differences in the level of development and average incomes between these countries. `German tourists` spent the most by far, nearly 19 million PLN over three years. Interestingly, `Belarusian tourists` spent almost as much as `French or Italian tourists`, despite the larger number of tourists from France and Italy and the significant differences in the level of development between these countries.
